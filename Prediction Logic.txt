# Match Prediction Logic Guide

This guide outlines the prediction logic behind the Guru Gyan rAi Cricket Match Prediction Dashboard. It uses historical match data from `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx` and multiple logic layers including team color theory, venue strength, and weekday-based performance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prediction Modes

The web app supports two prediction modes:

* **Pre-Match Prediction**
* **Inning Break Prediction** *(Logic for this is not covered here yet)*

---

## üîç Pre-Match Prediction Inputs

User must fill in:

* Team A Name (required)
* Team B Name (required)
* Match Format (T20 / ODI) (required)
* Gender (Male / Female) (required)
* Match Date (optional, defaults to today)
* League Name (optional, default = ALL)
* Stadium (optional)

---

## üìä Prediction Steps

### 1. Identify Match Day

* From the Match Date, calculate day of the week (e.g., `2025-05-21` ‚Üí Wednesday)
* Get color(s) associated with that day from `Day Colors` sheet (Column A: Day, Column B: Color Name, Column C: Hex Code)

### 2. Analyze Team A Color Match

* Get Team A jersey and flag colors from `Team Colors` sheet:

  * Column C: Jersey Main
  * Column D‚ÄìE: Jersey Alt colors
  * Column F‚ÄìK: Flag colors

* Match day colors with jersey/flag colors:

  * ‚úÖ 70%+ match with Jersey Main (Col C) ‚Üí 100% weight
  * ‚úÖ 30%+ match with Jersey Alt (Col D/E) ‚Üí 60% weight
  * ‚úÖ 25%¬±5% match with Flag Colors ‚Üí 30% weight

### 3. Repeat Color Analysis for Team B

Same process for Team B using its row in `Team Colors`.

---

### 4. Filter Relevant Sheets

If league is not selected (i.e. `ALL`):

* Use Match Format and Gender to filter sheets via `Index` sheet:

  * Column A: Format
  * Column B: Gender
  * Column D: League Name

---

### 5. Team‚Äôs Weekday Performance

* For Team A:

  * Total matches on that weekday
  * Total wins ‚Üí calculate weekday win %
* For Team B:

  * Same process

### 6. Head-to-Head Weekday Analysis

* Team A vs Team B matches played **only on that weekday**
* Who won more matches on that day

### 6.1 Extended Head-to-Head Analysis (Impact-Based)
- **High Impact**: Head-to-Head matches on selected **weekday** (any stadium)
- **Moderate Impact**: Head-to-Head matches at selected **stadium** (any weekday)
- **Normal Impact**: Head-to-Head matches on **any day** and **any stadium**

---

### 7. Venue-Based Performance

If Stadium selected:

* **High Impact**: Matches on selected day at selected stadium for each team
* **Moderate Impact**: All matches at that stadium for each team

---

### 8. Final Score Calculation

Average all factors:

* Color Impact
* Weekday History
* Head-to-Head on that day
* Venue Performance

Display final weighted prediction for each team.

---

## ‚úÖ Normalization

* Normalize `Female` and `Women` to a common gender tag
* Normalize team names like `USA` and `United States of America`, `UAE` and `United Arab Emirates`

---

## üìå Notes

* Hex color comparison should support 70%+ matching logic (can use color distance formulas)
* Stadium suggestions should work with either country name or partial stadium characters
* Dropdown for leagues must be dynamically populated from `Index` sheet, Column D

---

This logic ensures a data-driven, explainable, and customizable prediction system that evolves as historical data grows.

# Inning Break Prediction Logic Guide

This document defines the full flow of the Inning Break Prediction mode for the Guru Gyan rAi system.
When the first innings is completed and the user has provided a target, this logic computes winning probabilities 
based on contextual historical data.

---

## üéØ User Inputs Required

* Team A Name *(Bat First)*
* Team B Name *(Chasing)*
* Match Format: T20 / ODI
* Gender: Male / Female
* Match Date (e.g. 21-05-2025)
* League Name (Optional)
* Stadium Name (Optional)
* Team A Score *(e.g. 183)*

---

## üìä Prediction Steps

### 1. Identify Match Day

* Convert match date to **weekday** (e.g. 2025-05-21 ‚Üí Wednesday)
* Lookup associated **day colors** from `Day Colors` sheet (A: Day, B: Color Name, C: Hex)

### 2. Analyze Team A Color Match

* Lookup Team A‚Äôs jersey/flag colors from `Team Colors` sheet:

  * Jersey Main: Column C
  * Alt Jersey: Columns D, E
  * Flag Colors: Columns F‚ÄìK

* Match color vs day color:

  * ‚úÖ 70%+ match ‚Üí 100% weight
  * ‚úÖ 30‚Äì69% match ‚Üí 60% weight
  * ‚úÖ 25%¬±5% in flag ‚Üí 30% weight

### 3. Analyze Team B Color Match

Same color comparison logic as Team A.

---

### 4. Filter Relevant Data Sheets

* If league = ALL ‚Üí Filter by Format + Gender from `Index` sheet

  * A: Format
  * B: Gender
  * D: League

---

### 5. Team Weekday Performance

* Check how both teams perform on the same **weekday** historically
* Calculate win % on that weekday

### 6. Head-to-Head Weekday Analysis

* Matches played between Team A vs Team B **on that weekday**
* Who won more frequently

### 6.1 Extended Head-to-Head Analysis

* **High Impact**: Head-to-Head on selected weekday (any stadium)
* **Moderate Impact**: Head-to-Head on selected stadium (any day)
* **Normal Impact**: Head-to-Head across all venues and all days

---

### 7. Venue Performance

* **High Impact**: Team‚Äôs performance on selected day + stadium
* **Moderate Impact**: Team‚Äôs overall record at that stadium

---

### 8. Score-Based Defense History (Very High Impact)

* How many times **Team A** (bat first) scored exact same runs and **successfully defended** it in selected league

### 9. Score Defense Pattern (Generic) (Very High Impact)

* How many times **any team** scored the same runs and **successfully defended** in the selected league

### 10. Score Defense Across Format (Same Format/Gender)

* Count how many times any team scored that value and **defended it** in **any league** in **same format and gender**

### 11. Digit-Based Logic (Very High Impact)

* Sum up the digits of score ‚Üí e.g. 183 = 1+8+3 = 12 ‚Üí use last digit = `2`
* Search for `Digit` column (T20 = Column K, ODI = Column Q)
* Count how many matches had same digit + check:

  * How many times **Bat First team** defended?
  * How many times it was chased?
* **Skip this step if:**

  * T20 score < 143
  * ODI score < 243

This layered logic helps determine win probability more accurately using history-based color theory, score pattern recognition, and match-day influence.
