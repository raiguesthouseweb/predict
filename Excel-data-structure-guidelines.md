## üß† How Prediction Works

The system uses the data above to generate predictions by evaluating:

* **Team matchups**: historical head-to-head performance
* **Stadium trends**: win/loss trends at specific venues
* **Score patterns**: how often specific scores are defended or chased
* **Date filters**: day-of-week analysis (e.g. how teams perform on Fridays)

These calculations are performed via helper functions defined in:

* `getHeadToHead`, `getStadiumMatches`, `getAllHeadToHead`, etc.
* Located in: `server/cricket/xlsxParser.ts`

## üìå What to Ignore

The following columns can be ignored for current prediction logic:

* J, K, M, N (Wickets & Overs)
* R (Notes)

These are reserved for future enhancement or visual display only.

---

## üîß Developer Notes for Trae

* Only read columns **A to Q** from each sheet
* Use standardized column names to map dynamically
* Sheet names can vary but structure is consistent
* Use filtering functions from `xlsxParser.ts` to query relevant match data
* Ensure encoding and newline handling is proper when parsing Excel

## ‚úÖ Summary

* `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx` contains all match history data
* `xlsxParser.ts` extracts it into structured format
* Prediction engine uses historical data trends, scores, venues, and team history
* Only relevant rows/columns are used per query

This structure allows seamless integration of Excel data into the web app‚Äôs prediction engine with low complexity and high performance.
