# Guru Gyan rAi Implementation Report

## 1. Installed fuzzysort
- Installed the 'fuzzysort' package using npm to resolve import errors in both TeamAutoSuggest.tsx and StadiumAutoSuggest.tsx.
- Attempted to install '@types/fuzzysort', but it does not exist in the npm registry. Used direct type annotations instead.

## 2. StadiumAutoSuggest.tsx
- Added explicit type for the 'result' parameter in the map function to resolve the implicit 'any' type warning.

## 3. TeamAutoSuggest.tsx
- Cleaned up the file by removing duplicate and misplaced useEffect hooks.
- Ensured all variables are properly scoped within the component.
- Added explicit type for the 'result' parameter in the map function to resolve the implicit 'any' type warning.

- All TypeScript errors and warnings related to 'fuzzysort' and implicit 'any' types have been resolved.
- The code is now cleaner and more maintainable.
