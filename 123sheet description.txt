# Excel Data Structure Guidelines for Match Prediction

This document provides a detailed overview of how the Excel file `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx` is structured and how its data is used by our cricket match prediction web application. It is intended for implementation guidance, particularly for integrating new logic or handing this off to Trae or any other developer.

## üîó Source Reference

* File: `server/cricket/xlsxParser.ts` ‚Üí Handles Excel reading
* Main data source: `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx`
* File documented in: `FullInformation.md`

## üìä Excel File Structure Overview

Each match sheet inside `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx` has a consistent layout, with one row per match and columns containing either overall game details or inning-wise performance milestones.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

* Every column in each sheet's **Row 1** contains the header that defines exactly what data it holds and which inning it relates to.
* This includes data like `6OVR`, `10OVR`, `15OVR`, `Target`, and equivalents for **both 1st and 2nd innings**.
* These should all be considered valid and structured inputs for prediction ‚Äî **nothing should be ignored in T20 or ODI formats.**
* Only Test & Multi-Day Match (MDM) sheets are **excluded from logic for now** due to unmatched innings formats.

Below is a per-format column description summary derived from each sheet‚Äôs header row:

### üßæ Key Columns by Format

The following columns exist in both T20 and ODI sheets and should be parsed completely. These include milestone scores at various overs (6, 10, 15, 20), full inning totals, and all available performance indicators. Columns are ordered as they appear in the sheet (A to R):

| Column | Description                         | Inning     | Used in Prediction? |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |

| M      | 6-Over Score (2nd Inning)           | 2nd Inning | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| N      | 10-Over Score (2nd Inning)          | 2nd Inning | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| O      | 15-Over Score (2nd Inning)          | 2nd Inning | ‚úÖ Yes               |

| T      | Match Notes (Optional)              | Global     | Optional            |

All of the above columns must be retained while parsing. None are to be ignored in the current logic for T20 or ODI formats.

Test/MDM sheets are excluded due to irregular innings breakdowns and will be processed separately in the future.

## üß† How Prediction Works

The system uses the data above to generate predictions by evaluating:

* **Team matchups**: historical head-to-head performance
* **Stadium trends**: win/loss trends at specific venues
* **Score patterns**: how often specific scores are defended or chased
* **Date filters**: day-of-week analysis (e.g. how teams perform on Fridays)

These calculations are performed via helper functions defined in:

* `getHeadToHead`, `getStadiumMatches`, `getAllHeadToHead`, etc.
* Located in: `server/cricket/xlsxParser.ts`

---

## üìå What to Ignore

As of now, **no columns from T20 or ODI formats are ignored**. Every inning milestone (6OVR, 10OVR, etc.) is relevant and should be retained.

Only the following sheets are excluded from parsing for now:

* Test Women
* TEST M
* Plunket Shield Multi Day Match
* Sheffield Shield MMD
* Multi Day Domestic (MDM) England

These formats do not follow consistent limited-overs inning structures.

---

## üîß Developer Notes for Trae

* Only read columns **A to Q** from each sheet
* Use standardized column names to map dynamically
* Sheet names can vary but structure is consistent
* Use filtering functions from `xlsxParser.ts` to query relevant match data
* Ensure encoding and newline handling is proper when parsing Excel

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* `Categorized_Match_List.xlsx` contains all match history data
* `xlsxParser.ts` extracts it into structured format
* Prediction engine uses historical data trends, scores, venues, and team history
* Only relevant rows/columns are used per query

This structure allows seamless integration of Excel data into the web app‚Äôs prediction engine with low complexity and high performance.
