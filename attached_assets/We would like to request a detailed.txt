We would like to request a detailed reference document for the "Guru Gyan rAi" web application. This file will serve as the central technical guide for our team and future contributors.

The document should include the following:

Complete File Structure

List all files and directories used in the project with their relative paths.

Mention the purpose of each file.

Code Description

For every file, describe what type of code is inside (e.g., React component, data parser, utility function).

Clearly explain the technologies/libraries used (e.g., React, TailwindCSS, Express, CSV parser, etc.).

Project Architecture

Explain the overall structure: frontend/backend separation, key modules, and flow of data.

Describe how predictions are processed and served.

UI Reference

For all visible text or labels in the UI, specify:

In which file and which line (if possible) the text exists.

How to change its styling (especially color) without reading the entire codebase.

Mention Tailwind or CSS classes used for text styling.

Prediction Flow

Step-by-step description of how user input flows from the form to the backend and returns a result.

Include how CSV files are selected and processed dynamically via index.csv.

Customization Guide

Instructions for editing styles, fonts, layouts, and color themes.

Mention reusable components or layout wrappers if any.

Please ensure the file is beginner-friendly, written in plain and professional language, and includes enough detail to help any future developer navigate and maintain the codebase efficiently.
