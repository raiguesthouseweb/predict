# Guru Gyan rAi – App Debug and Fix Instructions for Replit Developer

This document outlines **all current bugs, missing features, and required fixes** based on the current state of the deployed web application. Please address **each issue one by one** using the descriptions provided. This must align strictly with the functionality and design goals shared earlier.

## ✅ PRIMARY ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. **Team Suggestion Not Working**

* Issue: Typing into Team A or Team B field shows no autocomplete or suggestions.
* Fix:

  * Ensure that `Teams.csv` from `/cricket/data/` is properly parsed at runtime.
  * The input field must use that list dynamically to show team suggestions (autocomplete).
  * There must not be a dropdown. It should be type-to-suggest.

### 2. **Stadium Suggestions Not Working**

* Issue: Typing stadium name shows no intelligent suggestion.
* Fix:

  * Extract unique stadium names dynamically by scanning all match files listed in `Index.csv`.
  * Combine stadiums from ODI.csv, T20.csv, BBL T20.csv etc.
  * Use the same type-to-suggest behavior as teams.

## 🛠 FUNCTIONAL BREAKDOWNS

### 3. **Prediction Always Returns 50-50**

* Issue: Final prediction result always returns 50%-50%.
* Fix:

  * Ensure the logic defined in the roadmap files is implemented:

    * Head-to-head win rate
    * Stadium performance history
    * Day-wise results
    * Team color matching
    * Color clash penalty or boost
    * Score digit pattern logic (post-1st inning)
  * Fetch data correctly from the provided CSVs.
  * Return weighted percentage instead of equal default.

### 4. **CSV Parsing Failure Suspected**

* Issue: Logic seems to fail due to incorrect parsing or indexing.
* Fix:

  * Ensure that `Index.csv` is parsed on app load to determine which match files to scan.
  * All file names and paths are case-sensitive; verify spelling and file format.
  * Format and Gendre in Index.csv must be case-insensitive during comparison.

## 🎨 UI & UX CORRECTIONS

### 5. **No Home Page or Animated Entry**

* Issue: App jumps straight into prediction fields.
* Fix:

  * Add a proper home page/splash screen with branding and “Start Prediction” CTA.
  * Display animated loading screen simulating system boot (Matrix/NASA style).

### 6. **Logo Not Properly Placed**

* Issue: Logo `rAi.png` not implemented or placed poorly.
* Fix:

  * Logo should appear top-left on all pages and on the home page splash.
  * Adjust size and position for desktop and mobile.

### 7. **Web App Not Mobile Friendly**

* Issue: Layout is breaking or cut off on smaller screens.
* Fix:

  * Ensure responsive design using Tailwind CSS or proper media queries.
  * Input boxes, buttons, and prediction panels must stack and scale on mobile.

## ☁️ WEATHER WIDGET ISSUES

### 8. **Weather Data Not Loading or Inaccurate**

* Issue: Weather info is not fetched or not location-specific.
* Fix:

  * Extract **city name** from selected stadium dynamically.
  * Use OpenWeatherMap (or similar) to fetch forecast for that city.
  * If format is **T20**: show rain probability for next 4 hours.
  * If format is **ODI**: show rain probability for next 10 hours.
  * Display result below prediction as:

    > "Rain chance in London (next 10 hrs): 12%"

## 🔁 FILE INTEGRATION CONFIRMATION

Ensure these files are **read and integrated correctly**:

* `Index.csv` → Used to route correct match files based on Format + Gender.
* `Teams.csv` → Used to power autocomplete in Team A and Team B.
* `ODI.csv`, `T20.csv`, `BBL T20.csv`, etc. → Used for extracting matches, stadiums, win history.
* `team colors.csv`, `day colors.csv` → Used for color theory and day-based match influence.

---

## 🔚 FINAL DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS

* Fully functional Guru Gyan rAi app.
* All major filters and prediction logic working.
* Mobile responsive.
* Weather and UI visual enhancement included.
* Export prediction button functional.
* Ready to deploy on local system or AWS.

If you need clarification on any point, please refer to the earlier roadmap files or reach out.
